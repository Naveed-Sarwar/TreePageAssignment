        <h2>Trees Information</h2>
        <p>Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
            Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals,
            and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the
            fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, plants form
            the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants"), a group that includes the flowering plants,
            conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae,
            but excludes the red and brown algae.

            Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are
            derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives
            them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal
            amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are
            characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also
            common.

        <h2>Algae</h2>
        <p>

            Green algae from Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur, 1904.
            Main article: Algae
            Algae comprise several different groups of organisms which produce food by photosynthesis and thus have
            traditionally been included in the plant kingdom. The seaweeds range from large multicellular algae to
            single-celled organisms and are classified into three groups, the green algae, red algae and brown algae.
            There is good evidence that the brown algae evolved independently from the others, from non-photosynthetic
            ancestors that formed endosymbiotic relationships with red algae rather than from cyanobacteria, and they
            are no longer classified as plants as defined here.[23][24]</p>
        <h2>Fungi</h2>
        <p>
            Linnaeus' original classification placed the fungi within the Plantae, since they were unquestionably
            neither animals or minerals and these were the only other alternatives. With 19th century developments in
            microbiology, Ernst Haeckel introduced the new kingdom Protista in addition to Plantae and Animalia, but
            whether fungi were best placed in the Plantae or should be reclassified as protists remained controversial.
            In 1969, Robert Whittaker proposed the creation of the kingdom Fungi. Molecular evidence has since shown
            that the most recent common ancestor (concestor), of the Fungi was probably more similar to that of the
            Animalia than to that of Plantae or any other kingdom.[28]</p>
